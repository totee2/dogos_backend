This project provides the backend to the website www.toteetown.com

The idea of the project is to facilitate the adoption of shelter dogs by letting a Machine Learning algorithm propose you dogs that you find visually appealing.
The code in this project is capable of receiving queries from the website and responding with the appropriate reply. The replies are all precomputed so that the code just gets out the correct reply from a Mongo Database.
